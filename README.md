## Basic Knowledge

	Works on the principle of Frogger game. We have a player and we uses the up, down, left and right arrow keys to move our player and reach the top of the canvas, avoiding all enemies that comes between.
	Once we reacher the top of the canvas, the game resets and the player reaches the bottom the canvas from where we initially started.

## Working Explained

	We have been provided with sprite of canvas and various sprites of all the player avatars. Each time the game stars, a new player avatar loads. We have various enemies, on various lanes of the canvas which are moving with different speed.
	Our job is to use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to move the player to the top of the canvas (here, water on the canvas) to complete the game avoiding all enemies that comes between.
	If, the player collides with the enemies, the player is send back to its initial location which is at the bottom of the canvas, from where the player initially started.
	Once, the player reaches the top position, the game completes resetting the it changing the player's location back to initials and providing enemies with different speed to move horizontally across the canvas.
